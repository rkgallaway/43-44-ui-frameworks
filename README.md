![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) JS Framework Comparative Analysis
=======================================================================

## Framework Name: VueJS

### Research Conducted By: Becca Lee, Jacob Anderson, and Ryan Gallaway

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 8
#### General Comments
Not as readable as it could be, some of the aspects are not intuitive. Otherwise, fairly doable and easy to work with.

#### Pros
* Fast Learning Curve (if up to speed on React)
* Importable as HTML library

#### Cons
* Readability
* Not intuitive

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
Great documentation. Very thorough examples on how it's like an unlike other frameworks, and comprehensive examples of how to handle different things that may arise. It's clear that the docs are meant to be friendly to new users and want to provide context to help prospective users understand the framework.

#### Systems Requirements
There are two ways to use Vue in your project:
1) Include it in your html page
2) Install the npm package to get access to features such as interactive project scaffolding, access to Vue's library of plugins, a full GUI for creation and management of projects

#### Ramp-Up Projections
Ramping up with Vue would have a bit of a learning curve in terms of syntax and structure of the code, but if the dev team is familiar with React it should be a relatively painless transition.


#### Community Support and Adoption levels
Vue.js has and seen its share of popularity.  As of March 2018, the 13 top companies using VueJS include Facebook NewsFeed, Netflix, Adobe (Portfolio), Xiaomi, Alibaba, WizzAir, EuroNews, Grammarly, Laracasts, GitLab, Codeship, Livestorm, Behance. It remains less popular than React, largely due to the lack of company ownership.
